Mathematics in CS



- content

  - Discrete Mathematics

    - sets relations proof methods 

  - Discrete Mathematical Structures 

    - numbers graphs trees counting

  - Discrete Probability Theory

- What dose Discrete means

  - the ability to discreting 

- Proofs

  - a^2 + b^2 = c^2 in a triangle

  - the interesting thing between Graph and Caculate. Elegant and correct

  - but something lack of the infomations

- Roots of ax^2 + bx + c =&gt; \[-b +-√ \(b^2-4ac\)\]/2 

  "a !== 0  D !==0"

- Proof by contradiction

  - make a suppose eg

    - Is ^3√ 1332 &lt;= 11?

    - if so 1332&lt;=1231 this is not true

    - so ^3√ 1332 &gt; 11

  - If an assertion implies something false then the assertion itself must be false

  - √ 2 is irrational

    - suppose √ 2 was rational 

    - so have n d intergers without common prime fators such that √ 2 = n/d

    - so n and  d are even

    - √ 2 = n/d

    - 2d^2 = n^2

    - so n is even
